### CASE Database

This solution contains the SQL code for the database backing the CASE standards and competencies for the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills. The database in this repo targets an unofficial implementation of IMS Global's CASE&trade; standard. The live implementation for the TEKS resides [here](https://teks-api.texasgateway.org/ims/case/v1p0/doc/).
